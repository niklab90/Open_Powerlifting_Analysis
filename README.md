# Open_Powerlifting_Analysis
An analysis of the open powerlifting dataset, mainly for getting used to working in R, but perhaps interisting to some folks. 
Includes: EDA, quite a few visualizations of every kind, mainly using ggplot2, a few t-tests and ANOVAs, clustering and a very basic random forest. 

There is a TL;DR up front, in case you do not want to read the entire thing.
