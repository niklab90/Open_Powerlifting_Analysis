# Open_Powerlifting_Analysis
An analysis of the open powerlifting dataset (https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/), mainly for getting used to working in R, but perhaps interisting to some folks. 
Includes: EDA, quite a few visualizations of every kind, mainly using ggplot2, a few t-tests and ANOVAs, a clustering attempt, a very basic random forest and all kinds of weird interpretation attempts.  

There is a TL;DR up front, in case you do not want to read the entire thing.
